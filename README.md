***##Incident Analysis & Resolution##***    |     *Last year in month of march we have decided to call local AC service Man for AC servicing then he gave us time for next day for a visit, then he visited and he told us for gas leakage and ask for refilling the gas and assure us for better performance of AC and after two days AC was not cooling properly then again we had to call to that same person then he came and told us for indoor replacement and charged for two services which was very hard to give but we had no options at that time*.
